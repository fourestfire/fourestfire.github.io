            <h4> August </h4>
              <li> Spent this time mostly settling in. Jenny and my Dad came out to help set up! </li>
              <li> Had Owen's Bachelor Party and his and Yushi's wedding. </li>
              <li> Played a ton of sports ... basketball, beach volleyball, soccer, you name it. Also went indoor skydiving - real skydiving is next. </li>
              <li> Orientation was a blur of meeting new people, but first week of classes were chill. </li>
          </p>

            <h4> September </h4>
              <li> Things get real fast, with classes in full swing. We have our three big fall Haas events in September - Boats, Yosemite, and Vegas. Extracurriculars start heating up. </li>
              <li> I'm part of the first year band, and we had our first gig opening for the second years! Our setlist: Coldplay - Yellow, Tenacious D - Tribute, Curtis Mayfield - Move on Up, Blink 182 - What's My Age Again </li>
              <li> HaasBoats was 400 of us on Lake Shasta over Labor Day, divided up into 14 person houseboats. Lots of floaties, some speedboat / wakeboarding action. </li>
              <li> First time at Yosemite. Did a 13 mile hike which had stunning views the whole way through. </li>
              <li> Vegas is the last big Haas event for the semester. Hakkasan, Daylight Club, and then XS, where I was able to catch the Chainsmokers with Lillian, Jolyn, King, Frank & Nao. Was destroyed by the end but was an amazing time. </li>
