            <h3>What is DropMix?</h3>

            <p> DropMix is a music mixing game created through a partnership between Hasbro (Monopoly, Playskool, Transformers, etc.) and Harmonix (Rock Band series). It uses NFC and Bluetooth technology to link physical cards with an Android or iOS device.</p>

            <p> There are multiple modes to DropMix. At the core of each mode, players place cards on the board that represent a sample of a song (e.g. the vocal track from Sia's 'Chandelier', or the bass track from LMFAO's 'Sexy and I Know It'). These samples are overlaid and automatically mixed into an ongoing track. </p>

            <h3>Simplicity</h3>

            <p> Music to me is all about collaboration and having a shared experience. As a guitarist and pianist, I love playing and recording songs with other musicians, but I absolutely love that DropMix allows me to share my passion with non-musicians. There are a lot of people that think they're not a creative person, when that's simply not true. Everyone has the capacity to create and make art. </p>

            <p> DropMix simplifies the art of DJing and working with samples through its design. It's a classic tradeoff that product managers have to make &ndash; how do you strike a balance between being simple but yet still feature rich? The products that I love tend to be more on the simple side. I believe that with simplicity comes ease of use and delight. DropMix does exactly that, as it abstracts out a lot of the complexities in beatmatching and tuning that's required when DJing normally. What Hasbro and Harmonix came up with is still eminently flexible and musical, but simple enough that it feels like magic. </p>

            <h3>Blending Physical & Digital</h3>

            <p> Another reason DropMix feels like magic is because of the way it effortlessly links physical playing cards to the digital screen through NFC. This creates an engaging and intuitive user experience. There's joy in taking a card, putting it neatly into a slot, and seeing it light up the screen. </p>

            <div class="row flex">

            </div>

            <br />
            <p> The interaction and blurring between physical and digital is a theme we'll be seeing more and more, and it's something I welcome. By augmenting our physical spaces through IoT, AR, and other technologies, we can reshift our focus away from our mobile devices and help us engage with the world in a new way. </p>

            <h3>Doing Difficult Things</h3>

            <p>  Innovation is hard in any industry, and it often comes from taking best practices and learnings from different fields and combining them in novel ways. From the music licensing, to the music generation algorithm, to the NFC-embedded cards, and to the iOS and Android apps, there are so many moving parts that had to be accounted for. Establishing a corporate partnership presents its own challenges, with the bureaucracy and difficulty in figuring out the licensing and distribution terms. </p>

            <p> But behind everything, they had a vision that helped guide them through the complexities of designing and executing DropMix. I have a lot of respect for the Hasbro and Harmonix teams for creating a product that is truly unique and magical. </p>
