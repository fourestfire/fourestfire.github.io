          <h3>The TLDR:</h3>
          <p> School is surprisingly tough academically, and there is a lot of random social stuff / extracurriculars, but it's a lot of fun. I'm living with two other first years in North Berkeley, and our class has ~280 people. We're then divided up into 4 cohorts. I'm in Gold (the best cohort), and within that, I'm in a 6 person study team that meets every week. </p>
          <p> Careerwise, I'm trying to recruit for product management positions at big tech companies. A lot of this happens in the spring, so there's still a bit of time before then, but ideally we need to start reaching out to alumni and companies in the fall. </p>
          <p> People are very smart here, and I feel very average, which is perhaps an amazing thing as there is a lot of room to grow. I'm being exposed to a lot of people with different backgrounds. There are a lot of consulting and finance people, but within my cohort, we also have an ex-Marine focused on anti-terrorism, a professional cook who has appeared on Food network, and a lot of people who've done really cool social impact work. </p>

            <h4> August </h4>
              <li> Spent this time mostly settling in. Jenny and my Dad came out to help set up! </li>
              <li> Had Owen's Bachelor Party and his and Yushi's wedding. </li>
              <li> Played a ton of sports ... basketball, beach volleyball, soccer, you name it. Also went indoor skydiving - real skydiving is next. </li>
              <li> Orientation was a blur of meeting new people, but first week of classes were chill. </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4> September </h4>
              <li> Things get real fast, with classes in full swing. We have our three big fall Haas events in September - Boats, Yosemite, and Vegas. Extracurriculars start heating up. </li>
              <li> I'm part of the first year band, and we had our first gig opening for the second years! Our setlist: Coldplay - Yellow, Tenacious D - Tribute, Curtis Mayfield - Move on Up, Blink 182 - What's My Age Again </li>
              <li> HaasBoats was 400 of us on Lake Shasta over Labor Day, divided up into 14 person houseboats. Lots of floaties, some speedboat / wakeboarding action. </li>
              <li> First time at Yosemite. Did a 13 mile hike which had stunning views the whole way through. </li>
              <li> Vegas is the last big Haas event for the semester. Hakkasan, Daylight Club, and then XS, where I was able to catch the Chainsmokers with Lillian, Jolyn, King, Frank & Nao. Was destroyed by the end but was an amazing time. </li>
